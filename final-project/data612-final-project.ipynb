    "\n",
    "In this final project I will demonstrate the main recommender system techniqiues learned in the class. I will demonstrate how to implement **Collaborative Filtering**, **Content-Based Filtering** and **Hybrid method** in Python for the task of providing personalized recommendations to the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background on Recommender System Techniques\n",
    "* **Collaborative Filtering:** This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content-Based Filtering:** This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hybrid method:** Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem."

    "#### Collaborative Filtering model\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering (CF) has two main implementation strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory-based: This approach uses the memory of previous users interactions to compute users similarities based on items they've interacted (user-based approach) or compute items similarities based on the users that have interacted with them (item-based approach).\n",
    "A typical example of this approach is User Neighbourhood-based CF, in which the top-N similar users (usually computed using Pearson correlation) for a user are selected and used to recommend items those similar users liked, but the current user have not interacted yet. This approach is very simple to implement, but usually do not scale well for many users. A nice Python implementation of this approach in available in Crab.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model-based: This approach, models are developed using different machine learning algorithms to recommend items to users. There are many model-based CF algorithms, like neural networks, bayesian networks, clustering models, and latent factor models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and, probabilistic latent semantic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent factor models compress user-item matrix into a low-dimensional representation in terms of latent factors. One advantage of using this approach is that instead of having a high dimensional matrix containing abundant number of missing values we will be dealing with a much smaller matrix in lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A reduced presentation could be utilized for either user-based or item-based neighborhood algorithms that are presented in the previous section. There are several advantages with this paradigm. It handles the sparsity of the original matrix better than memory based ones. Also comparing similarity on the resulting matrix is much more scalable especially in dealing with large sparse datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we a use popular latent factor model named Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). There are other matrix factorization frameworks more specific to CF you might try, like surprise, mrec or python-recsys. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An important decision is the number of factors to factor the user-item matrix. The higher the number of factors, the more precise is the factorization in the original matrix reconstructions. Therefore, if the model is allowed to memorize too much details of the original matrix, it may not generalize well for data it was not trained on. Reducing the number of factors increases the model generalization.\n",
