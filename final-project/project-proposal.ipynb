    "In this final project I wanted to demonstrate most of the techniques I learned in data612 course. Also I wanted to use dataset other than famous movie rating dataset since I used it in my previous assignments. Currently I am working on NLP project in my company and I wanted to use some kind of text processing in my project.I wanted to implement hybrid approach which I haven't implemented in my previous assignments."

    "I am using dataset [Articles Sharing and Reading from CI&T Desktop](https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/articles-sharing-reading-from-cit-deskdrop) from kaggle website. This rich and rare dataset contains a real sample of 12 months logs (Mar. 2016 - Feb. 2017) from CI&T's Internal Communication platform (DeskDrop). \n",

    "\n",
    "* Item attributes: Articles' original URL, title, and content plain text are available in two languages (English and Portuguese).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contextual information: Context of the users visits, like date/time, client (mobile native app / browser) and geolocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logged users: All users are required to login in the platform, providing a long-term tracking of users preferences (not depending on cookies in devices).\n",

    "* Rich implicit feedback: Different interaction types were logged, making it possible to infer the user's level of interest in the articles (eg. comments > likes > views).\n",

I haven't implemented content based filtering and Hybrid approach in my earlier assignments. Also I will compare the results from these 3 approaches."
